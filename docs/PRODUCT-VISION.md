# Bevyly - Product Vision

> **"Your AI Sales Team That Never Sleeps"**

---

## Executive Summary

Bevyly is an **intent-driven autonomous sales operating system** that fundamentally reimagines how sales teams operate. Instead of humans doing repetitive prospecting work while software provides dashboards, Bevyly flips the model: **AI agents handle the entire BDR workflow** while humans focus on what they do best—building relationships and closing deals.

---

## The Problem

Modern sales teams waste enormous time on:

- **Manual prospecting** — Hours searching for leads that match ICP
- **Data entry** — Copy-pasting between tools, enriching records
- **Cold outreach** — Writing and sending hundreds of personalized emails
- **Follow-ups** — Tracking who to contact and when
- **Tool sprawl** — Juggling 10+ SaaS products that don't integrate

The result: Sales reps spend only 30% of their time actually selling.
